# Classified
A simple, open source Java class file parser and explorer, written in Java 17.

This project is highly a **work in-progress**, and is for research purposes only at this time. In the future, I may 
write a Swing UI and continue this project further. This project may also eventually grow into a full JVM in the far 
future.

Contributions are more than welcome, and as per LICENSE, you may use any part of this project for personal or 
commercial use with the proper attributions.
